# More recent note: having pr and ps, then gradp, etc, is a bit werid.  cannot take derivative wrt ps, so perhaps change notation

# TODO
# - remove line numbers from generated functions, inline what need inlined, remove bounds checks where appropriate
# - deal with transpose for ce, ci.
# - remove f() in the knownsolutions eval, unncessary and creates a headache


 # - for forwarddiff processing, cast results properly

# NOTE(i): We leave the return types fairly vague and allow caller to specify whether they want sparse, dense, or even static arrays.


# NOTE reminders to self:
# - Type stability: return types should not depend on values but can depend on input types
# - Use argument types for multiple dispatch, it does not improve performance in general
# - Explicit return type annotation seems to degrate performance

# TODO should probably inline the small functions in each model definition
# TODO check ForwardDiff cfg
# TODO saving of lower order derivatives?
